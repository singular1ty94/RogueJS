#RogueJs Development ToDo's
Vision taking shape: a fun roguelike where weapons and abilities are picked up/used without consent,
making players take educated risks.

## Fun Stuff
* Blood splatters

## Serious Stuff
* Ranged enemies
* Stats tracking
* Better levelling up
* Ability pickups

## Experimental
* Resizing the game window
* Enemies with their own FOV/sight outside player's FOV

#Roadmap
* Endgame
* More abilities and pickups
* More enemies and tactics
* More things for the player to "do"
