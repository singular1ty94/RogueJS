#RogueJs Development ToDo's
Vision taking shape: a fun roguelike where weapons and abilities are picked up/used without consent,
making players take educated risks.

## Balance Notes
* More frequent chests
* Less HP gain with XP boosts

## Fun Stuff

## Serious Stuff
* Ranged enemies
* Stats tracking
* Better levelling up

## Experimental
* Enemies with their own FOV/sight outside player's FOV
* Change to speed-based schedule

#Roadmap
* Endgame
* More abilities and pickups
* More enemies and tactics
* More things for the player to "do"
